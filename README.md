# Active - Angular Single Page Application

This application is a front end focus social media SPA. The components may resemble other platforms for its asthetics. As this project scale, the functionality will showcase how unique it can be. This program is one of two parts for the full stack application. It requires my back end API application linked [here](https://github.com/t-hendricks/active-spring-boot-api) in order to make http requests and load data.

## Initial Approach

My motto when learning any new subject or developing new ideas is 'function over fashion'. I want the components to be tangible and active. So I kept my initial design plain as possible to reduce scope creep.
